Live previews are an experimental feature introduced in `v3` to provide updates on a live page of your website while you update the content in your CMS. Currently this feature only works with react based projects, such as [NextJS](https://nestjs.com/).

## Getting Started

You can turn on live previews for either the whole CMS, individual collections or individual files in a collection.

Simply update your `editor` config with a url template for the live editor to use to load your live pages.

```yaml

```javascript
editor: {
  live_preview: ''
}
```
